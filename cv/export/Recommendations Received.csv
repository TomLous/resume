Paul,de Jong,Self-Employed,Freelance UX / UI Designer,"Tom is a smart, professional and fun person to work with. His natural understanding of complex data structures and technical knowledge has never ceased to amaze me. When I was working on the same projects with Tom he always came up with feasible technical solutions that would match with our (sometimes crazy) ideas and designs. Besides his technical management and communication skills he is also a very good developer!","10/27/13, 5:30 AM",VISIBLE
